The `client.py` and `echo_server.py` are by CMPUT404 instruction team 

The `proxy_server.py`, `proxy_client.py`, `multi_server.py` are written based on the lab instruction and the `echo_server.py`

**Note** my machine's local ip address was 192.168.31.26, so if comment out line 51 in `client.py` then comment line 50. The code will connect to the echo server
