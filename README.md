### Citation
The `client.py` and `echo_server.py` are by CMPUT404 instruction team 

The `proxy_server.py`, `proxy_client.py`, `multi_server.py` are written based on the lab instruction and the `echo_server.py`

### Local machine
My machine's local ip address was 192.168.31.26, so if comment out line 51 in `client.py` then comment line 50. The code will connect to the echo server

### Multi-tasking server
I have wrote the multi-tasking echo server and multi-tasking proxy server in one file called `fork_server.py`, by switching comment out line 32 and 33, you could have echo and proxy server respectively
